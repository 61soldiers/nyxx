### Features

- *Commands framework* <br>
  Faster way of creating commands for bot. You just  have to implement one class, and initialize framework. Everything is done automatically. 
- *Cross Platform* <br>
  Nyxx works on the command line, browser, mobile, and can be transpiled to JavaScript.
- *Fine Control* <br>
  Nyxx allows you to control every outgoing HTTP request or websocket messages.
- *Internal Sharding* <br>
  Nyxx automatically spawns shards for your bot, but you can override this and spawn a custom number of shards. Internal sharding means that all of your bots servers are managed in one script, no need for communication between shards.
- *Complete* <br>
  Nyxx support nearly all DiscordAPI endpoints.
